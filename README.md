### What is boids simulation?
The boids model simulates the flocking behavior of birds and has since become a benchmark for research in the field of artificial life and swarm intelligence. The boids model is a simple artificial life program that simulates the behavior of a flock of birds. Each "boid" is represented as a simple object with a position, velocity, and acceleration. The behavior of each boid is governed by three simple rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion. Separation ensures that each boid maintains a safe distance from its neighbors, alignment ensures that each boid aligns its velocity with the group, and cohesion ensures that each boid moves towards the average position of its neighbors.

### Techniques Use In Application Of Boids
* Rule-base technique: consists of the three rules that Craig Reynolds stated in 1986
* Simulation Time Step: consists of the discrete time step where boids can take which are calculated based the position and velocity at the previous step
* Graphics and Visualization:  is technique to render the shapes to be used for boids and obstacles
* Steering Behavior: which allow the boids to respond to the environment and make decisions about where to move next if there are obstacles on the way
